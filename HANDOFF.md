## Step 1 – Website on Hostinger
0. Domain: kirkcaldydental.co.uk is held by Google (Squarespace Domains). In Hostinger add the website to get its IP, then in Google Admin → Domains → DNS add an A record for "@" to that IP and a CNAME "www" → kirkcaldydental.co.uk. Don't touch the MX records (email).
1. hostinger.co.uk → Websites → kirkcaldydental.co.uk → File Manager → `public_html`.
2. Delete any default `index.php` / `default.php`.
3. Upload the website zip → right-click → Extract. `index.html`, `privacy.html` and `assets/` must sit directly in `public_html`.
4. Security → SSL → enable.
5. Check https://kirkcaldydental.co.uk and https://kirkcaldydental.co.uk/privacy.html load.
6. Emails → create mailbox info@kirkcaldydental.co.uk.

## Step 2 – Meta lead form (Meta Business Suite → All tools → Instant Forms)
- Form type: Higher intent
- Intro headline: "Be first in line – join our waiting list"
- Intro text: "Kirkcaldy Dental & Implant Clinic is a new NHS dental practice opening soon in Kirkcaldy. Join our waiting list and we'll keep you updated with opening news."
- Questions: Full name, Phone, Email (prefill) + Post code + multiple choice:
  - "How many people are you registering interest for?" 1 / 2 / 3 / 4+
  - "Are you currently registered with a dentist?" Yes / No / Not sure

- Business Settings → Integrations → Leads access → allow Zapier for the page.

## Step 3 – ClickSend
Sign up, top up ~£20, Sender ID `KirkDental`, copy username + API key.

## Step 4 – Zapier (Starter plan)
Trigger: Facebook Lead Ads → New Lead (clinic page + form above)
1. Google Sheets → Create Spreadsheet Row → sheet above. Signup Time = lead Created Time; map the other columns; Source = facebook; leave Status/Notes blank.
2. ClickSend → Send SMS → To: phone, From: KirkDental, Message:
   "Hi {First Name}, thanks for registering your interest in Kirkcaldy Dental & Implant Clinic, the new NHS dental practice opening in Kirkcaldy. We'll keep you updated with opening news. kirkcaldydental.co.uk"
3. Gmail (or Hostinger mail) → Send Email → To: email

   Body:
   "Hi {First Name},
   Thank you for registering your interest in Kirkcaldy Dental & Implant Clinic, a new NHS dental practice opening soon in Kirkcaldy.
   We'll be in touch with opening dates and practice information as soon as they're confirmed.
   Any questions? Email info@kirkcaldydental.co.uk.
   Kirkcaldy Dental & Implant Clinic
   kirkcaldydental.co.uk"
4. Test with Meta's Lead Ads Testing Tool: row appears in the sheet, SMS arrives, email arrives. Then publish the Zap.

## Step 5 – Campaign (Ads Manager) – confirm with owner before publishing
- Objective: Leads → Instant forms. One campaign, ONE ad set.
- Budget: £15–25/day. Location: Kirkcaldy + ~10 miles, "People living in this location". Age 18–65+. No detailed interests. Placements: Advantage+.
- Two ads in the same ad set, both using the form above:
  - Ad A: feed = `ad-A-feed-4x5.png`, Stories/Reels = `ad-A-video-9x16.mp4` (fallback `ad-A-stories-9x16.png`)
  - Ad B: feed = `ad-B-feed-4x5.png`, Stories/Reels = `ad-B-video-9x16.mp4` (fallback `ad-B-stories-9x16.png`)
- Primary text (Ad A): "🦷 A new NHS dental practice is opening soon in Kirkcaldy! Be first in line – tap Sign up to join our waiting list."
- Primary text (Ad B): "👨‍👩‍👧 Looking for an NHS dentist for the whole family? A new NHS practice is opening soon in Kirkcaldy. Join our waiting list in 30 seconds."
- Headline: "New NHS dental practice – opening soon". CTA button: Sign up.
- After 5–7 days compare cost per lead; pause the weaker ad.

## Step 6 – Banner, leaflet and QR sign-up page
Full instructions are in `leaflet/README.md` and `banner/README.md`. Short version:
1. The website zip contains `register/`. Make sure https://kirkcaldydental.co.uk/register/ loads before printing anything: the QR codes on the banner and leaflet open that page.
2. In the Waiting List sheet, go to Extensions → Apps Script, paste in `leaflet/apps-script.gs` and deploy it as a Web app (Execute as: Me, Access: Anyone). Paste the /exec URL into `site/register/index.html` (replace `PASTE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE`) and re-upload that file.
3. Test by scanning the QR code on the leaflet: a row should appear with Source = leaflet, and the thank-you email should arrive.
4. Phone number: not set yet (Dentally has a placeholder). When it exists, add it with `cd leaflet/source && node render.js "01592 ..."` and add it to the banner.
5. Address: 23–25 Tolbooth Street, Kirkcaldy KY1 1RW.
